# AI Labs

## Overview
This repository, contains laboratory assignments completed during the 4th semester of Computer Science studies. The goal of these labs is to explore various machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques through hands-on coding exercises.

## Lab 1: Linear Regression
### Description
The first laboratory focuses on implementing a simple **Linear Regression** model to predict fuel efficiency (**MPG - Miles Per Gallon**) based on vehicle weight. The model is implemented using two different approaches:
1. **Closed-Form Solution** (Normal Equation)
2. **Batch Gradient Descent**
